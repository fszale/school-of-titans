The metadata is best implemented using a widely accepted and human readable format such as YAML or JSON. This is an idea that has been tried and true for many years with great success across a wide variety of IT shops.</p> <p>Let's unpack this concept a bit.</p> <p>Here we have a process flow diagram with multiple boxes and connecting lines that describe a construction project. Each box performs some action, while each line that connects the boxes has properties that describe the interaction between the boxes themselves.</p> <p>These properties is what we refer to as the metadata.</p> <p>You can see that the process remains the same even though it is leveraged to build a brand new home, condo or renovate an existing property before handing the keys to the client. This is very similar in how we apply a configuration driven design in the systems that we build. The same process remains intact while the individual components can be easily substituted and used in multiple ways.</p> <p>One of the inherent pillars of the configuration driven design is that it allows us to reduce the volume of modifications to the code base. The configuration metadata is well suited to reflect continuous changes to business requirements, component parameters and sequence of execution. In addition, we can utilize non-engineering team members to perform and test configuration changes. As a result, engineers move faster as they focus on critical engineering tasks instead.</p> <p>Another great pillar of the configuration driven design is the simplicity of the solution. Team members can control entire system behavior using only the  configuration files. These configuration files employ a human friendly naming convention and an easy to comprehend structure. Simple text editing tools such as notepad or just about any other text editor can be sufficient enough to implement desired changes.</p> <p>Ok, so now we know what configuration driven design is all about. There are a few good rules to follow that will assure success and minimize implementation risks. - Keep it simple, begin with very small set of parameters, tasks and business rules to minimize the complexity of the configuration file itself. - Change the configuration only when needed, you do not need to account for all edge cases from the get go. - Test continuously, after every change and no mater how small it is. The key here is the frequency of testing as well as the depth of the applied test cases.</p> <p>Let's talk about the clear upside of this approach.</p> <p>The configuration driven approach is a way to gain technology independence since the process complexity, that's the task execution sequence, parameters and business rules, are externalized away from the underlying implementation.  In effect, its a bit easier to swap out individual components of the system and their underlying technology. A consistent reuse of configuration files will assist engineers to eliminate duplicated code. And when properly structured and labeled, configuration files can become code like in their effectiveness while retaining their user friendly appearance.</p> <p>On the downside, we should avoid implementing sophisticated business rules using configuration files. Business rules are complex in nature and tend to evolve over time, as frequency of rule changes increases so does their complexity. There are widely used  rule engines such as Drools and InRule that are a much better suited for this purpose.  Of course, what defines a complex business rule is a judgment call, therefore it deserves its own conversation.</p> <p>You can find the full code for this project at https://github.com/fszale/configuration-driven-design.</p>"},{"location":"engineering/#rules-engine","title":"Rules Engine","text":"<p>The only constant is change itself.</p> <p>Business rules, data elements, boundary conditions and related metadata changes frequently. Rules engines provide a very effective approach to extrapolating the ever changing rules out of the fixed code base. Such an approach allows to expand the team capable of implementing logic changes and eliminates a need for an engineer to perform mundane code updates. Anyone on the project can now update business rules as required and engineers are allowed to focus on other critical parts of the project instead.</p> <p></p> <p>Over the years, I have observed and worked on many code projects that have implement various business rules as inline code. While this approach produced fast working code it has often yielded unnecessary maintenance work. The engineer would be forced to entertain a perpetual flow of minuscule tasks, more often than not with a sole purpose to change a single line of code. Rules engines have been around for a long time and served well as an alternative approach. Implementations of rules engines are not free of their own challenges and often come with limitations pertaining to performance and rule complexity. However, rules engine can empower business analysts and other project members to perform updates to business rules without a dependency on the engineer. Considering the nature of our universe with an ever increasing rate of changes to various business rules, scarcity of engineering resources and the never ending onslaught of tasks, rules engines have become a pervasive part of our coding landscape.</p> <p>One of the great benefits of implementing a rules engine is an opportunity for implementing a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process. Given that the rules themselves can and should be versioned as code, it only makes sense to implemented an effective deployment process. The following is a visualization of aforementioned process:</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine a CircleCi or Jenkins based deployment pipeline, where the dev/test deployment is kicked off as soon as rules source file is checked in. This is an effective approach to distribute workload of logic development among non-engineers and maintain consistent deployment process independent of who modifies the rules.</p> <p>Another excellent benefit of implementing a rules engine is the depth of logging capabilities provided during the processing. In this example, I have utilized a Drools rules engine (https://www.drools.org/) and implemented enhanced logging capabilities to illustrate the depth of the information to be captured while processing data objects and evaluating complex rules. The example below illustrates several types of logged information, such as which rule was successfully evaluated, data lineage identifier to logically group lifetime processing of a particular data object, activity id to group batch data processing also referred to as an invocation instance.</p> <pre><code>...\n2019-10-20 21:36:48 INFO  test-logger:120 - Rules engine initializing 0.0 ...\n2019-10-20 21:36:49 INFO  test-logger:190 - CK CreateKieContainer\n2019-10-20 21:36:49 INFO  test-logger:195 - CK Processing ruleKey: TestRules.drl\n2019-10-20 21:36:49 INFO  test-logger:212 - CK Resolved ruleKey: TestRules.drl\n2019-10-20 21:36:49 INFO  test-logger:226 - CK Adding module.\n2019-10-20 21:36:49 INFO  test-logger:233 - CK Building ...\n2019-10-20 21:36:52 INFO  test-logger:243 - CK Building Complete.\n2019-10-20 21:36:52 INFO  test-logger:252 - CK Return new container.\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:124 - Rules engine initializing 0.1 ...\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:138 - Rules engine initialized.\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:60 - RulesEngine obj created dataLineageId: 123.0 runActivityId: ABCDEF\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:7 - Check_sqfootage_over1000 was invoked\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:131 - [RULE_ENGINE] : {\"dataLineageId\":\"123.0\",\"runActivityId\":\"ABCDEF\",\"Package\":\"com.rules.test123\",\"Rule\":\"init_logger\"}\n2019-10-20 21:36:53 INFO  test-logger:131 - [RULE_ENGINE] : {\"dataLineageId\":\"123.0\",\"runActivityId\":\"ABCDEF\",\"Package\":\"com.rules.test123\",\"Rule\":\"check_sqfootage_over1000\"}\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Imagine detailed dashboards that summarize the rules processed at multiple complexity levels and deriving unique insights into the flow of processed data and rules applied across time. These dashboards and associated charts can only be derived from the data written to the logs.</p> <p>I have assembled a base project to illustrate an implementation of a Drools rules engine, a rules engine code factory to cache rule sets, property files, log files and sample set of processing rules to be applied to a test data entity. This code is fully reusable out of the box, can be leveraged in a Java based project and deployed across various containers such as AWS Lambda, EC2, AWS Glue (PySpark), EMR and others.</p> <p>You can find the full code for this project at https://github.com/fszale/drools-rules-engine. I have been using a rules based approach very successfully over many years and in a wide variety of systems. Most recently, my focus is on development of Big Data ETL processing with Spark/PySpark, data science and machine learning solutions where rules engines seem to thrive tremendously.</p>"},{"location":"engineering/#code-generator","title":"Code Generator","text":"<p>Writing code to generate code is a winning strategy.</p> <p>Over the years I have written a lot of code. Typically, the code was purpose built to represent objects in memory, perform object value manipulation according to predefined rules then persist the output somewhere. Simple. Yet, I have often wondered if much of that code had to be written in the first place. As I have pondered such questions, my long term memory started to activate providing ample flashbacks of various projects. There were a good number of them where I have purposefully applied a code generator. Perhaps, I did have a moment of brilliance in the past and did not force myself to write everything from scratch. Perhaps the concept of a scaffolding code generator has been around for a long time \u2026 perhaps it is the secret behind an awe inducing productivity of small teams \u2026 perhaps it should be a major component of code writing code, perhaps \u2026</p> <p>I have been a long time subscriber of this concept. In fact, the code generation has been a key success factor on a number of projects I have been involved in. So, after a short deliberation, several late night hours and intravenous delivery of caffeine (delicious coffee) I have produced a simple python based code generator to illustrate the concept of a configuration driven code generator.</p> <p>The process begins with the code initializing itself with instructions contained in the JSON configuration file. The main engine class then invokes those instructions in sequence, instantiating specified implementation class, passing in additional parameters and invoking the main process (take action) method, process diagram is featured below.</p> <p></p> <p>The following is a sample of a JSON based configuration file that drives the code generator engine. As specified, the \u201cimplementation\u201d parameter identifies the class to be instantiated to perform a primary action, while \u201cparams\u201d section contains all of the specific values controlling the processing invoked. This is a simple and effective implementation of a configuration driven (functional programming) paradigm.</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"Code Generator\",\n    \"description\": \"Your application description...\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"task_list\": [\n        {\n            \"task_name\": \"your.task.name\",\n            \"implementation\": \"folder.module_name.class_name\",\n            \"params\": {\n                \"source\": {\n                    \"file_name\": \"./file_path\"\n                },\n                \"transformer\": {\n                    \"file_name\": \"./file_path\"\n                },\n                \"output\": {\n                    \"file_name\": \"./file_path\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n    ...\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>An interesting component of this generic code generator is that each of the tasks can be easily swapped out with an alternative implementation or simply expanded upon. The code generator engine is driven purely by the JSON configuration file and as such can be re-purposed for various applications. The provided example performs two simple transformations, first is an XSLT transformation of an XML file that produces a JSON file with its own unique format representing all of the data contained in the input file. The second transformation produces a series of working Python based classes as defined by the contents of the XML input file. This example can be easily extended with additional transformations to produce Java, .NET or other code. In fact, this code generator is so generic that it can be used to produce other JSON based configuration files and code generators.</p> <p>You can find the code for this project at https://github.com/fszale/object-to-code-generator.</p> <p>I have been using this model of code generation to successfully produce code and configuration files. The input to the generator consist of object definitions documented with modeling tools that export XML based entity definition files. However, this is just one possible use and you are encouraged to fork and modify the provided code base. Python was the language of choice as majority of my time is focused on big data and machine learning projects, however, given the simplicity of this project the code could easily be ported to language of your choice.</p>"},{"location":"engineering/#moonshot-architecture","title":"\u201cMoonshot\u201d Architecture","text":"<p>Discuss future state also known as the \u201cmoonshot\u201d.

The compute layer runs independently as well, with a dedicated tech stack that may vary greatly from the ingestion or the delivery systems. This is where the rules engines and streaming as well as batch (spark or similar) technologies rein supreme. The delivery system, again a fully independent, also has its own SLAs, redundancy and processing for each of its subscribers (consuming clients).

This is about being savvy with the resources provided. Frugality, in a way, is the ultimate test of one's abilities to execute. Given a finite set of resources (for example money, time, people and materials) the ultimate measure of one's ability to create something out of nothing lies on the other side of the accomplishment.</p> <p>Jeff Bezos said he believes frugality is a positive thing because it drives innovation. He clarified: \"I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.\"</p> <p>A system based approach can be equally effective for personal as well as professional environments.  Apply the 80/20 rule to focus your frugality effort on the 20% of what matters to deliver 80% of the results.</p> <p>Let's begin with your personal frugality, make peace with buying used depreciating assets (i.e. used car, used books on amazon, used bicycle) to limit the expense, use the saved monies to invest in index mutual funds instead.  For example, buy a used car instead of new, you will save on insurance and the overall cost of the vehicle which depreciates rapidly when brand new. You can still enjoy fine dining, nice clothes, a vacation as those are expenses that have smaller financial impact.  </p> <p>The same frugality based approach applies in a professional setting. Instead of developing a new software product from scratch, consider leveraging an open source project that delivers just enough functionality to test the idea with.  Given a need to hire another person full time, consider a combination of a part time consultant and SaaS software instead.</p> <p>Tim Ferriss has an interesting article about this very subject titled \"Where Are You Still Using Single-Ply?\", another simple system based approach is outlined in the following article.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#think-long-term","title":"Think long term","text":"<p>Thinking long term is the typically the domain of the CEOs and strategic thinkers. These visionaries think decades into the future and they often make bold long term bets that shape our future. \u2018It\u2019s all about the long term.\u2019 That was the title of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 first letter to shareholders in 1997. In another quote Jeff Bezos said \u201cWe can\u2019t realize our potential as people or companies, unless we plan for the long term.\u201d  Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant and many others also share in this belief.</p> <p>So how can you benefit from such foresight?</p> <p>Naval Ravikant has a great quote on twitter, \"Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\" This is his idea of how to apply long term thinking, there is a great write up on his blog with the title \"Play Long-term Games With Long-term People\".  The title says it all. Align yourself with like minded individuals to work and play with. The trust and respect developed over time allows each other to better focus on building a better vision of the mutually beneficial future.  And with every passing iteration that trust compounds.</p> <p>Another great article talks about how \"Bezos, Musk, &amp; Buffett See The World Differently, Because They See Time Differently\", effectively outlining their 4 dimensional thinking pattern that accounts for time variable as the key to effective long term thinking.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#become-a-rational-optimist","title":"Become a rational optimist","text":"<p>Naval Ravikant has made an interesting comment, \"To create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.\"</p> <p>Rational optimists make asymmetric bets where the upside is unlimited, while the downside is capped. Pessimists often overanalyze the downside. They convince themselves the risk is too high on all opportunities and usually end up doing nothing. Rational optimists analyze the downside and assess whether they will avoid ruin if it fails. The downside in a first world country is relatively small. Even bankruptcy can be endured and recovered from.</p> <p>Smart, pessimistic people, talk themselves out of all sorts of opportunities because they fear a downside that doesn\u2019t exist. Becoming a rational optimist solves this.</p> <p>You can find an excellent writeup about Here\u2019s Why You Should Become A Rational Optimist.

There are many possibilities, but all will require an investment of your time and in some cases money.  You can google for ideas here but its difficult to apply such generic advice and expect tangible results.</p> <p>Again we reach for a system based approach, one that allows you to identify and validate the idea first.  </p> <p>For all forms of business a personal network is fundamental, this is the group of people you are connected to that you can provide value to. You network can and is willing to help, always ask for help and you will be surprised to find that most people are willing to help. Your network is often the first source of your clients, ideas, new connections and can also provide validation of your ideas. If you have a small network, invest in building one, always ask how you can help others, add value wherever possible.  Take the time and find ways to grow it, use LinkedIn as much as possible but also do not forget to meet and talk to people. The post Covid world has accelerated the migration towards remote work environment and made the quick online meetings easier than before, social networks such as Clubhouse also provide an easy and fun way to connect with new people.</p> <p>The next component is to look for opportunities. Look for something that is a passion of yours as that significantly increases the odds of resilience in face of adversity. Also, find something others hate doing and offer to do it for them instead. Let others outsource their problems (your opportunities) to you. You can easily register an LLC, get business insurance and work as a consultant in addition to your primary source of income.  Perhaps over time, you can apply a system to the problem, use automation and build a solution that scales in order to progress to a self sustaining business without requiring major investment of your time. To increase probability of success, apply the 80/20 rule to deliver most impact as fast as possible. Become customer obsessed, see what Jeff Bezos has to say about his customer obsession here.</p> <p>Here is an excellent writeup on building startups with real advice, you can also join Angel List in search of others to partner up with, there are many opportunities for project based work and small engagements that generate income but do not conflict with your primary job.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#public-speaking","title":"Public speaking","text":"<p>Much has been written and said about public speaking.

Amazon has a robust metrics system in which everything that matters can be tracked, measured and analyzed with insights generated and routine decisions automated.  This system empowers Bezos, executives and frontline employees to focus more on what matters and away from managing routine daily chores. Amazon is not alone, all businesses utilize metrics in some capacity.</p> <p>Given what metrics do for a business, should we track and measure personal metrics?</p> <p>If you have a Fitbit, or Apple watch then you are already familiar with collecting metrics for your own personal benefit (health tracking).  Try applying a system based approach and collect and compare metrics in the context of major aspects of you own life. Apply the 80/20 rule to focus on the things that deliver the most impact with the least amount effort.  For example, anytime you have a big purchase to make (i.e. car), begin by identifying the key metrics you are concerned with, then expand those with another set that is a lot more granular, ask others for feedback on the metrics, compare and contrast the data, and make the decision based on the metrics.  </p> <p>For more ideas about personal metrics please read \"Metrics that Matter\", Tim Ferriss also has a great article about \"Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics\".</p>"},{"location":"tools/#bias-towards-action","title":"Bias towards action","text":"<p>Jeff Bezos has one of the principal leadership values defined as bias for action and it reads as follows \"Speed matters in business.
