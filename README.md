# school-of-titans
School of Titans is an approach for human development. It is a practical yet simple process I have effectively utilized over the years to help people become better at "everything". It has been mostly tested with software engineers and engineering leaders but has also proven to be effective with people from non-engineering professions.

I do this to help people evolve and permanently alter their reality, this is how I impact the very fabric of the universe which I believe to be the collective human consciousness.
