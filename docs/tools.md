### 30/60/90 plan
- Are you about to start a new project and don't know how?
- How do you define and prioritize the work?
- What system could you apply to organize yourself and the team?

This is a system to organize activity in order to provide clarity on how to proceed.  For simplicity of understanding consider 30 to be immediate, 60 as near term and 90 as the long term.

  1. Begin the work by gathering requirements necessary to define the following:

  - Vision
  - Objectives
  - Key Results
  - Stakeholder

  2. The next step is to create a planning matrix as follows:

  | Right Now (30) | Medium Term (60) | Long Term (90) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Build Solution | Build Solution | Build Solution |
  | Data Provisions | Data Provisions | Data Provisions |
  | Increase Adoption | Increase Adoption | Increase Adoption |

  This is an example of a product development matrix but it can be adapted to any situation.

  3. The next step is to identify and classify activity for each of the placeholders within the above matrix.  In other words, given the appropriate “time” bucket (for example "Right Now (30)") begin by breaking down the objectives into tasks that must happen immediately. For example, prototyping and end to end test (“Hello World”) system should be in the first 30.

### 80/20 rule
Another effective system to decide priority of execution is known as the ["Pareto Principle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), often referred to as the 80/20 rule.  The basic premise is that 20% of the identified work is responsible for the 80% of the outcome value. This approach can be combined with another system, for example the 30/60/90 plan.  In such a scenario, the work activity identified in each of the "time" buckets would be prioritized as to first begin the work on a small subset of the activities (the 20%) that delivers 80% of the results.

### Career Progression
- Do you wonder what's next?  
- How can you judge the next opportunity?
- What should you do?
- Stay or go?

This is a system based approach to apply judgement to the decision making process that impacts your career.  Please, rate the following four items in the order of importance to you, and only you (do not consider external input).

- Money
- Power
- Experience
- Creation

The order of the above four items indicates how you should evaluate the opportunity you are considering.  Write down your understanding of the situation in the context of the topic (Money, Power, Experience, Creation).  Simplify your writing, remove unnecessary adjectives and review.  Your writing should be simple, crisp, keep sentences less than 13 words long.  

Now imagine placing these topics on a balance scale, your first topic should feel as if its 80% of the total weight.  If it does, then this is what is truly important to you and should be used to decide your next move.
