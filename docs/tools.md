### Systems over Goals
A goal is a clearly defined objective that a person wants to achieve.  A system is a process which facilitates progress towards a goal.

Goal focused people often experience an emotional roller-coaster depending on whether the goal is achieved or not. Systems oriented people succeed every time they apply the process towards a goal.  

Systems win in the long run.  

One of the best examples of a system based approach is reflected in Amazon's management leadership practices.  Their system facilitates a relentless forward progress towards objectives.  It continues to scale exceptionally well, Amazon's present size of the organization, market share, product differentiation and customer loyalty are at unprecedented levels and continue to grow.

James Clear (author of ["Atomic Habits"](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)) has an excellent post about goals vs systems [here](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems). Scott Adams (author of "Dilbert") has also written an excellent post about goals vs systems [here](https://www.scottadamssays.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/).

For an excellent introduction to the Amazon management system please read ["The Amazon Management System: The Ultimate Digital Business Engine That Creates Extraordinary Value for Both Customers and Shareholders"](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Management-System-Extraordinary-Shareholders-ebook/dp/B081S5YPK8) book.

### Fasting
- Do you feel sluggish after your meals?
- Is your brain a bit foggy at times?
- Does your blood sugar spike up and down?
- Are you having trouble focusing?

Intermittent fasting is a system of restricting food intake in order to help the body expend stored calories. I have experienced multiple benefits of this approach and have been practicing various forms of intermittent fasting over many years.

A common form of intermittent fasting is the 16/8 method which involves limiting consumption of foods and calorie-containing beverages to a set window of eight hours per day and abstaining from food for the remaining 16 hours.

This cycle can be repeated as frequently as you like and is popular especially among those looking to lose weight and burn fat. While other diets often set strict rules and regulations, 16/8 intermittent fasting is easy to follow and can provide real results with minimal effort. It’s generally considered less restrictive and more flexible than many other diet plans and can easily fit into just about any lifestyle.

For additional information please look at this Harvard funded [study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/time-to-try-intermittent-fasting) and for a practical how to guide read this [article](https://perfectketo.com/16-8-intermittent-fasting-ketosis/).

This is not medical advice, please check with your doctor first before attempting to fast.

### Daily mindfulness and/or meditation
Mindfulness is a type of meditation where you have to intentionally focus on whatever is happening without injecting your bias to interpret and/or pass judgement.

I find this skill to be an enabler for developing unbiased mindset necessary to lead with empathy.

I find reading about this subject overwhelming and often impossible to verify.  You need to discover your own approach to develop this skill. I have been practicing for years and can confirm that mindful meditation allowed my brain to forge new neural pathways.  It has also materially altered my perspective on how to interpret our reality. In my personal experience, the benefits of this practice result in heighten sense of self awareness, unbiased judgment, profound increase of empathy and compassion, emotional stability, accurate perception of other people emotional state and mental calmness under all circumstances.

This is a complex area of study and I encourage you to search and discover your own research materials. One the few books I could "connect with" is ["Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation"](https://www.amazon.com/Practicing-Mindfulness-Introduction-Great-Courses-ebook/dp/B07CNLSXC2), although it was impossible for me to maintain focus while reading it. I opted for the audio version instead and spent many hours walking the dog while absorbing and practicing the content as advised.

### Continuous reading
- Are you seeking knowledge?
- Do you want to become a better writer?
- Are you looking to grow your ability to comprehend?
- Seeking alternative perspectives?
- Do you want to improve your odds of success?

Continuous reading is yet another system to learn from others, perhaps even more important as a system of discovery for what mistakes to avoid. Reading helps us better understand people on an intimate level, may even help increase our empathy. Books challenge us to grow, as your mind is forced to wrestle in order to comprehend. At times you can feel the neural pathways forming.

A great perspective on reading can be found in a blog titled ["Why Read? Advice From Harold Bloom"](https://fs.blog/2020/10/why-read/), and another great source of reading tips come from no other than [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/) on this [blog post](https://alexandbooks.com/archive/16-reading-tips-from-naval-ravikant)

### Attain focus by listening to a single song/binaural beats
- Are you having trouble focusing?
- Is it difficult for you to calm your mind?
- Is your brain having a million thoughts a minute and you need a break?
- Are you finding practicing mindfulness difficult?

Binaural beat is a multi tone signal you hear with a slightly different frequency per ear. Your brain processes a beat at the difference of the frequencies resulting in a series of surprising effects.

Binaural beats are often associated with practice of meditation, a number of additional benefits have also been identified:

- reduced anxiety
- increases focus and concentration
- lowers stress
- foster positive moods
- promotes creativity
- helps to manage pain

I have experienced all of the above outcomes as a result of listening to binaural beats daily and recommend that you find an iOS/Android app for your phone. Most of these apps come with pre-configured beat frequencies commonly found to induce a particular mood, meditative state, increased focus or simply assist with falling asleep. I have also experienced similar results by listening to the same song continuously over an extended period of time.

For additional information please look at this ["Auditory Beat Stimulation and its Effects on Cognition and Mood States"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428073/) research study and for practical how to guide read this [article](https://www.healthline.com/health/binaural-beats#potential-benefits).

### "Spec" work, create a project and try to sell it
Spec work is when you create a product content such as video, song, script, code, website, design, graphic, other artifacts first and then attempt to find a buyer to sell it to.

This is one of the most common experiences shared by successful people featured in the ["Tools of Titans"](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788) book by [Tim Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/c/timferriss). They have all created some form of "spec" work and then attempted to find a prospective buyer in order to sell the artifact, license the content or create a new business opportunity based on the idea itself.

- Why then have all these people attempted this endeavor?
- What is their motivation?
- What can we learn from this?

It is impossible to read other people minds and its easy to speculate what each person's personal motives might have been. Perhaps, it is a character trait that made these people successful to begin with, a willingness to take a leap of faith. "You will never know unless you try", this quote is often attributed to public figures, try googling it.

Think of this as a learning opportunity and to increase probability of success we must apply a system, so consider the following creative process:

- Identify "spec" work
- Identify potential buyers
- Develop a 30/60/90 plan
- Apply the 80/20 rule
- Be creative, go Big

People often advise against this approach due to the perception that work presented to a non-committed buyer can be easily acquired without having to pay for the work performed, see an entire website dedicated to this topic [here](https://www.nospec.com/), then again none of these people were featured in the "Tools of Titans" book.

### Take supplements (vitamins)
If you have a healthy diet, a multivitamin supplement may have little or no benefit.

But how do you really know if you need to supplement vitamins?

It is best to ask your doctor about a blood test, it is a routine procedure often performed around the same time as your yearly physical examination.  The results will be telling and will arm you with knowledge to decide next steps.

 You may find yourself low on vitamin D if you live in darker places or your lifestyle limits exposure to sunlight, vitamin D is arguably the most important vitamin you could take. Whenever, you feel fatigued or have low energy, it's very possible that you are vitamin D deficient. For an in depth Harvard study on vitamin D please read the following article [Vitamin D and your health: Breaking old rules, raising new hopes](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/vitamin-d-and-your-health-breaking-old-rules-raising-new-hopes), another great source of information about vitamin D can be found in this [blog post](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vitamin-d-may-be-the-most-important-nutrient-you-need_b_8235466#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20is%20arguably%20the,Vitamin%20D%20levels%20are%20low.).

This is not medical advice, please check with your doctor first before taking vitamins.

### Exercise Daily
- Want to improve memory and mental sharpness?
- Need to reduces stress?
- How to promote creativity?

You already know that exercise is good for you. Exercise is one of those activities you need to make into a daily habit, and just in case you haev doubts please read all about the [benefits of regular physical activity article from Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389).  Most successful people have long adopted exercise as part of their daily regiment, click here to [google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=successfull+people+daily+exercise).

So why is it so hard?

This is yet another opportunity to implement a system, remember system over goals.  Do not feel obligated to begin with an objective to loose weight, gain strength or run a marathon.  Develop a process that will reduce friction preventing you from exercising daily.  For example, I have brought the 35lbs dumbbell and set it down in a visible place next to my desk.  Next, I have placed a yellow sticky note next to my keyboard, a bit of an eyesore but an effective reminder tool, with the following list:

- Curls
- Squats
- Pushups

This is a good start but still not as effective as I would like, it has worked maybe 60% of the time.  Another enhancement to this process is to pair the exercise with an activity that you find pleasurable.  This will help to train your brain to connect both activities together and the hard exercise will be mentally associated with a reward of some kind. So far I have found success with two different approaches, in the morning I drink coffee while exercising since I love coffee and in the afternoon I play one of my favorite 80's era inspirational songs ([Kickstart My Heart by Motley Crue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmXWkMlKFkI))

### 30/60/90 plan
- Are you about to start a new project and don't know how?
- How do you define and prioritize the work?
- What system could you apply to organize yourself and the team?

This is a system to organize activity in order to provide clarity on how to proceed.  For simplicity of understanding consider 30 to be immediate, 60 as near term and 90 as the long term.

Begin the work by gathering requirements necessary to define the following:

  - Vision
  - Objectives
  - Key Results
  - Stakeholder

The next step is to create a planning matrix as follows:

| Right Now (30) | Medium Term (60) | Long Term (90) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build Solution | Build Solution | Build Solution |
| Data Provisions | Data Provisions | Data Provisions |
| Increase Adoption | Increase Adoption | Increase Adoption |

This is an example of a product development matrix but it can be adapted to any situation.

The next step is to identify and classify activity for each of the placeholders within the above matrix.  In other words, given the appropriate “time” bucket (for example "Right Now (30)") begin by breaking down the objectives into tasks that must happen immediately. For example, prototyping and end to end test (“Hello World”) system should be in the first 30.

To see a practical example of a 30/60/90 plan focused on what to do in a new job [click here](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/30-60-90-day-plan).

### 80/20 rule
Another effective system to decide priority of execution is known as the ["Pareto Principle"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), often referred to as the 80/20 rule.  The basic premise is that 20% of the identified work is responsible for the 80% of the outcome value. This approach can be combined with another system, for example the 30/60/90 plan.  In such a scenario, the work activity identified in each of the "time" buckets would be prioritized as to first begin the work on a small subset of the activities (the 20%) that delivers 80% of the results.

### Financial literacy
Many Americans have little understanding of finances, responsible credit usage, and the long term impact of poor financial decisions. In fact, a lack of financial understanding has been signaled as one of the main reasons many Americans struggle with saving and investing. For additional details about financial literacy read the following [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/why-financial-literacy-and-education-so-important.asp), and learn about how inadequate are median retirement savings [here](https://www.synchronybank.com/blog/median-retirement-savings-by-age), note not to use average savings since those numbers include the billionaires and skew the numbers tremendously.

One of the best sources of basic financial information is provided by Fidelity on their website, [click here](https://www.fidelity.com/financial-basics/overview) for an excellent primer on financials basics.

Scott Adams (the Dilbert's creator) has created an effective [Dilbert’s One-Page Guide to Everything Financial](https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/the-dilbert-principles-of-personal-finance-an-infographic/):

- Make a will.
- Pay off your credit cards.
- Get term life insurance if you have a family to support.
- Fund your 401k to the maximum.
- Fund your IRA to the maximum.
- Buy a house if you want to live in a house and can afford it.
- Put six months worth of expenses in a money-market account.
- Take whatever money is left over and invest 70% in a stock index fund and 30% in a bond fund through any discount broker and never touch it until retirement.

If any of this confuses you, or you have something special going on (retirement, college planning, tax issues), hire a fee-based financial planner, NOT one who charges a percentage of your portfolio.

I would also add the following to this plan:

- Use 529 plan for college savings
- Get a universal insurance policy with a cash savings guaranteed rate but only if you are in your early 20s (insurance costs less when you are young)

This is it, a simple system to improve odds of financial well being and secure retirement.

### Career Progression
- Do you wonder what's next?  
- How can you judge the next opportunity?
- What should you do?
- Stay or go?

This is a system based approach to apply judgement to the decision making process that impacts your career.  Please, rate the following four items in the order of importance to you, and only you (do not consider external input).

- Money
- Power
- Experience
- Creation

The order of the above four items indicates how you should evaluate the opportunity you are considering.  Write down your understanding of the situation in the context of the topic (Money, Power, Experience, Creation).  Simplify your writing, remove unnecessary adjectives and review.  Your writing should be simple, crisp, keep sentences less than 13 words long.  

Now imagine placing these topics on a balance scale, your first topic should feel as if its 80% of the total weight.  If it does, then this is what is truly important to you and should be used to decide your next move.
