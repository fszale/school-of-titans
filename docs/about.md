I am an experienced engineer, architect, integrator and engineering leader with a long history of building software systems that empowers people to build and grow their businesses. I specifically excel at building engineering teams, software solutions and ecosystems efficiently, with minimal investment and record time to market.

Engineered scores of data centric systems utilizing a wide spectrum of technology stacks for Fortune 100, medium and small organizations, built a cutting edge system for securing monetary transactions over the Internet resulting in multiple patents and created a number of boutique software development businesses.

Most people view me as an experienced software builder that always gets it done no matter the circumstances. They most often recognize me for my technical expertise, engineering leadership, people development skills, strategic thinking, startup experience, creativity to build something out of nothing and ability to move mountains in the face of adversity.

For fun, I enjoy a variety of activities such as working on artificial intelligence, reading, riding motorcycles (dirt bikes), playing guitar, skydiving, playing drums, martial arts, spicy foods, flying planes, boating, skiing, studying alternative concepts in philosophy, history, archaeology and politics and anything else that someone else says is hard to do.
