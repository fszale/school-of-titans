    - > As Seth Godin says, "**The best way to change long-term behavior is with short-term feedback.**" The more immediate the feedback that you get, the quicker you can make adjustments to your behavior.
    - > I still think overnight success is a myth. Thereâ€™s no way to avoid one simple fact: you have to put in the work.  
        That said, these four strategies make rapid success more reasonable:  
        1\. Get short-term feedback.  
        2\. Simplify and eliminate distractions.  
        3\. Surround yourself with an environment that promotes your new behavior.  
        4\. Play a game that leverages your skill set.
    - This is also very helpful for people with a very influential "instant gratification monkey" (see Tim Urban's Ted Talk, [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU)).
