# Final Thought

I have spent a lifetime accumulating the ideas and knowledge reflected in this body of work, and will continue to add to it over time.  Having this information "codified" in a single place makes it easier to distribute and serves as an easy reference for other souls.  I dream that the content here helps someone on their life journey even if only partially.

<b>So what did I learn in the end?</b>

Turns out that time is the only non-renewable resource that we posses as human beings.  There is no store where you can simply walk into and purchase more time, its finite and its the most scarce resource there is.

[Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) has a number of great quotes that capture the essence of time and its importance.

- "Value your time. It is all you have. It’s more important than your money. It’s more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time."

- "The clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and to pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity."

- "It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time."

- "Don’t spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy."

I had finally come to terms with time, its importance and what really matters and that has driven me make a pivot in life.  

My focus is now to ...
